# A Professional README.md File Generator  
  by Brad Moleterno    ![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
## Description
This project is a generator that creates a Professional README.md file based on a series of fifteen questions that the user answers via a command line application. This project is a quintessential example of the usefulness of computing. Humans are not good at performing repetitive mundane tasks. These tasks are better left to a computer.  With the readme generator, much of the work required for creating a README.md file is handled by the computer. This frees up the coder to pursue more creative tasks. Since this program can be used more than once, it can be a valuable resource for future projects
